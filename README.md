**SurakshaNET Dashboard** is a modern, secure command and control interface designed for security operations and user management. Built with React and featuring a sleek dark theme, this dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities with a professional military-inspired design.### `npm run eject`



### Key Highlights:**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

- 🛡️ **Security-First Design** - Built with security operations in mind

- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX** - Clean, professional interface with smooth animationsIf you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly across all devices

- 🔐 **VPN Integration** - Simulated secure connection workflowsInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

- 📊 **Real-time Monitoring** - Live logs and security metrics

- ⚡ **High Performance** - Optimized React components with smooth animationsYou don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
